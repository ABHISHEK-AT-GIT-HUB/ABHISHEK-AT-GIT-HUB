### 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a software developer passionate about **full-stack development, AI automation, and interactive web experiences**. I love building clean, efficient, and visually engaging applications.  

- 🌟 Currently building a **Textile E-Commerce Platform** (MERN + Razorpay) with user/admin auth, cart, checkout, order tracking, and scalable admin routes.  
- 🦋 Working on **Butterfly Quiz** — a gamified learning platform that grows a flower garden as users answer quiz questions, ending with a butterfly landing on the final flower.  
- 💡 Exploring **React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB**, and **automation workflows**.
